<div><span><span>(Here’s an October 2017 profile we published on <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/ankhi-das-facebook-india/">Ankhi Das</a>, “Facebook’s most powerful official in India.”)</span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>The <em>WSJ</em> story by Newley Purnell and Jeff Horwitz serves as a great example to explain the invisible incentives that are at work in India. Incentives that explain why one of the world’s most powerful and ruthless technology companies is helpless to enforce its own rules. Or why this story was broken by the <em>WSJ</em> and not by any of India’s large and powerful media organisations.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>It’s a wicked problem, at the centre of which lie India’s 1.3 billion citizens. Access and control over this market is what drives the incentives of all the players. That access is increasingly gated and controlled through regulation, which in turn is driven by India’s government.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span><span>Facebook</span></span><span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>Let’s start with Facebook, for which India already is the largest market globally by number of users, with close to 300 million users. Unfettered, it absolutely has the product chops to use its Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram armada to get to, say, 600 million users. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>But Facebook faces formidable regulatory obstacles. Its digital payments service powered by WhatsApp has been <a href="https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/mobile/no-nod-to-whatsapp-to-go-live-on-full-scale-upi-operations-rbi/77295901">waiting for approvals</a> for over two years. The source of its competitive advantage—user data—faces the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/nationalisation-of-data-will-destroy-value-for-businesses-investors/">risk of nationalisation</a>. The Indian government wants it to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-court-facebook-idUSKBN1X11JR">break the encryption</a> that protects its user communications.</span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>Till last year, it <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/facebook-counters-mukesh-ambani-says-data-is-not-new-oil-shouldnt-be-hoarded-within-nations/articleshow/71095409.cms">tried to take on Reliance Industries</a>, India’s largest private conglomerate, by suggesting that India didn’t need to be protective about its citizen’s data. That ended a few months ago when it invested $5.7 billion in Reliance’s Jio Platforms.</span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>With virtually no competition among the 400 million Indians who are already users of social networks, Facebook has nothing to gain by enforcing even its own weak hate speech rules. Instead, it has everything to lose if it were to turn the ruling party, government, and regulators into its enemies.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span><strong>Indian media</strong></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><span>You’d expect India’s large, powerful and independent media organisations to act as a check against bad behaviour on Facebook’s part. Though not if you’d understand their incentives. Because, as American writer Upton Sinclair once said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>With the exception of perhaps the Times Group, India’s largest media company, most others are not only unprofitable but also struggling to transform their legacy revenue models into digital ones. Few want to take on a player like Facebook, which is so powerful in the digital ecosystem they hope to be a viable part of.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>Even if they did, given that the bulk of their revenue comes from advertisers and not readers, there isn’t much economic incentive for them to take on Facebook. To make the decision even harder, Facebook itself is currently <a href="https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1282530671844405250">sponsoring a news series</a> with the Times Group.</span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>Investigating Facebook’s close ties with the government would also risk alienating another source of revenue for India’s media groups—the government. Government advertising is a major source of revenue for most Indian news groups as this detailed report from Vidhi Legal titled <a href="https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/research/the-future-of-news-in-india/">“The Future of News in India”</a> explains. The report notes that the role of government advertising as a critical revenue source for newspapers has sparked “critical concerns” about transparency.</span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>The government could also play a role in helping India’s media groups earn more <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/belling-the-cat-online-ad-revenues-can-help-pay-for-journalism-australia-tells-google-facebook-to-share/">revenue</a> from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-editorials/google-facebook-must-pay-for-content/">Facebook</a>.</span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>Like Facebook, Indian media has everything to lose too.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span><strong>Government</strong></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><span>With the line between political party, elected government, and appointed regulators increasingly blurring, the biggest incentives are controlled by the government. India’s policies are increasingly sprawling in their scope and capable of reducing even billions of dollars in investments and tens of millions of users to nothing in the blink of a new policy.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>Would Facebook risk taking on the wrath of a government with so much at risk? Especially after Ankhi Das and Facebook may have <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/part-3-who-were-key-players-responsible-facebooks-support-modi-and-bjp">played a pivotal role</a> in helping elect India’s current government to its first term. </span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<div><span><span>Thus, it was almost logical for <em>WSJ</em>, an American publication, to be the one to expose Facebook’s behaviour in India. For the same reason that Facebook is being brought to action for its role in Myanmar’s genocide in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-world-court/u-s-court-asked-to-force-facebook-to-release-myanmar-officials-data-for-genocide-case-idUSKBN23H2E3">international and American courts</a>, not in Myanmar itself.</span></span></div>

<p><span><span>Incentives matter.</span></span></p>

<p> </p>
<div><span><span>On 14 August, Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s finance minister, held her <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1645800">third virtual meeting</a> to press central government-owned enterprises to spend half their outlay for the year ending March 2021 by September 2020. Capital expenditure (capex) by state-run companies is key to the government’s plan to revive an economy hamstrung by the pandemic. The Asian Development Bank expects the Indian economy to shrink <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/adb-expects-indias-economic-growth-to-slow-down-to-4-pc-in-fy21-on-coronavirus-pandemic/articleshow/74960057.cms?from=mdr">4%</a> in 2020-21. </span></span></div>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But Sitharaman did not have to wait too long to get a reality check. On the same day as her meeting, government-owned fuel retailer Bharat Petroleum Corporation cut its capex for this financial year by a third—to around Rs 8,000 crore ($1.1 billion). </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The country is staring at a gross tax revenue shortfall of Rs 4,32,000 crore (US$57.7 billion) in the financial year ended March 2021. The government needed to do something fast to plug this. So last week, the prime minister launched a new income tax platform, one that riffs on rewarding honesty and transparency.

<p><span><span>And of course, it was no thanks to the Covid-induced nationwide movement control order that was implemented on 18 March, which affected various business sectors, including import and export that were down 19.7% and 21.7%, respectively. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>This despite Malaysia registering less than 150 deaths and under 10,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>

The Philippines’ GDP <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/philippine-economy-posts-biggest-quarterly-plunge-200806051633703.html">shrank</a> 16.5% in the same period, also the worst in the country since 1981. </span></span></div>

<div><span><span>Even Singapore, the only advanced economy in Southeast Asia, is <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-lowers-2020-gdp-forecast-to-between-5-and-7-as-economy-plunges-worse-than">slumping</a> into a deeper recession. The city-state’s GDP contracted by 6.7% in the first half of 2020. </span></span></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>No single country could escape unscathed from a global pandemic. Not even the countries that have done well in curbing the spread of Covid-19 outbreaks because all countries and their economies are interconnected. Imports, exports, travel, labour movement. In return, the interconnection among countries is causing some of their neighbours to suffer a ‘proxy downturn’.</span></span></p>
